utilized advanced metrics for each nhl team along with stats collected for 1st 5 and 10 minute goals in nhl games, find use to find certain edges among lines in sports books in this niche market, along with score predicition

1. Scrape Hockey Game Data
You'll need to collect historical data from this season, including game scores, team stats, and player performances. To do this:

Find a reliable source (NHL API, ESPN, Hockey Reference, etc.).
Use Python for web scraping (requests, BeautifulSoup, or Selenium) or interact with an API (pandas.read_json(), requests.get()).
Store the data in a structured format (CSV, SQL database, or Pandas DataFrame).

2. Process and Clean the Data
Convert scraped data into a structured format.
Merge with your hockey_stats dataset.
Handle missing values, standardize formats, and engineer new features (e.g., team strength, home vs. away effects).

3. Feature Engineering
Consider adding these features to improve predictions:

Team stats: Goals per game, expected goals, shots on goal, power-play efficiency.
Player stats: Top scorers' recent performances, goalies' save percentages.
Situational factors: Home/away games, rest days, back-to-back games, injuries.

4. Build the Predictive Model
Split data into training and test sets.
Select a model: Consider regression models (XGBoost, Random Forest, Linear Regression) or deep learning (LSTMs if using sequential data).
Train and validate the model, using techniques like cross-validation.

5. Evaluate and Optimize
Use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), RÂ², or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess accuracy.
Tune hyperparameters (using GridSearchCV or Optuna).
Test the model on unseen data.
